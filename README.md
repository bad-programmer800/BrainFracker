# BrainFracker

BrainFracker is my second attempt to build tools to use to study brains. My goals are:
1) learn C++ programming
2) Create something useful that makes my work life easier
3) Document my learning with a Youtube channel
4) Have fun! 

## Starting Point
From attempt 1: My first commit is simply a reworking of the Hazel Game Engine created by TheCherno in his Youtube Game Engine series. I chose to start at a commit from around June 25, 2020. I chose this starting point because I wanted enough functionality that I could start experimenting with different code immediately, but I also wanted to have a bare bones system that I could learn and build. 

Now (2/2/2025): My starting point is about the same as last time. I have sepnt a lot of time learning different systems within Hazel and elsewhere. I feel like it is always 1 step forward and 0.9 steps backward. In other words slow! But I will keep trying.
